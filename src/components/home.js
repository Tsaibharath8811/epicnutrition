            </h3>
            <p>
            The development of human health is dependent mainly on nutrition. Improved nutrition boosts the immune system, makes pregnancies safer, increases mental alertness, and lowers the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
            According to the adage,<i><b>‘You are what you eat’</b></i> , people who eat well are healthier and more productive than those who don’t.

            The immediate advantages of transitioning to a healthy diet are higher energy levels. You can avoid blood sugar variations by cutting out extra fats, sweets, and refined carbs. White bread and sweets are two examples of refined carbs.

           What is a balanced diet?
           </i>
           </h6>
           <p>
           The number of calories in a food refers to the amount of energy stored in that food. Your body uses calories from food for walking, thinking, breathing, and other important functions.
           </p>

          The average person needs about 2,000 calories every day to maintain their weight, but the amount will depend on their age, sex, and physical activity level. A balanced diet gives your body the nutrients it needs to function correctly. 
        </p>
